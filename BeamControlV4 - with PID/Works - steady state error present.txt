Desired = 300
Actual = 350 or so (pretty consistent)
Next day: is around 320 or so now - interesting

It might be important to get rid of the oscillation due to derivative stuff (?)
-I'm going to try adding a (capped) I and see how it works, at any rate

I'm capping Icontr
-Should also probably cap the total (more instant updates)

Some reflections:
-Several important parameters to mess with for the I term
:where to cap it (max contribution)
:where to cap the error total (memory)
:how fast to update it (I coefficient)(

Perforamance compared to straight PD:
-Visually it's comparable
-I did tone down D (9 -> 8), so there's a bit less wobbling
-How's the steady state error?
